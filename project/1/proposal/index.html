                        A clickable lip gloss pen, in pink, that only pushes out a very minimal amount of formula when

                        This object is meaningful to me because it conserves formula and is thus cost-effective. I also
                        find
                        it really accessible – I have carpal tunnel, and squeezing a tube of lip gloss can be really
                        exhausting for my wrist, so clicking is a much less painful motion.

                    <p class="col-c">
                        I wanted a digital camera for a very very long time after losing the one I received for my tenth
                        birthday, and for Christmas my uncle gave me one he didn’t use.

            </div>
            <div class="proposal">
                <p>I would like to redesign my digital camera so it can be used comfortably with one hand, for
                    convenience
                    and accessibility. It’s bulky and the dial used to switch between Auto, Manual, Preview etc. modes
                    is
                    stiff and difficult to push without holding the camera in place. This improved camera will be
                    designed
                    for people with physical disabilities that prevent them from being able to hold a camera with both
                    hands, like a missing limb or weak arm, and for people who cannot put much strength into their
                    movements, such as people like myself with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. </p>
                <p>This improved camera will have a handheld remote to be used for navigation and shutter, separate from
                    the
                    camera itself (which will also have typical controls). Thus, this camera can be placed on a stable
                    surface who can then click the remote with their hand. The remote will also have a screen with a
                    preview
                    of the camera’s screen. This is inspired by the Apple Watch’s ability to connect to an iPhone, and
                    how
                    it can be used as a shutter button and preview. It can also be used like a typical camera. Because
                    it’s
                    meant for people with weaker holds, this product would be made of a lightweight magnesium compound,
                    which is often found in modern digital cameras for casual use, everyday, anywhere. I would also like
                    to
                    make the dial located on this camera and remote significantly easier to use, turning it into a touch
                    and
                    click interface – when they’re gently touched, an image shows on the screen indicating where the
                    touched
                    button leads to when clicked, similar to a hover function over a button on a laptop. I would like to
                    prototype this physical form with cardboard, for a stiff, but lightweight initial design, and cover
                    it
                    with some kind of dull aluminum foil to imitate its metallic exterior. <a

                    be

                    capability for a custom wrist strap, and a customizable startup screen.</p>
